# ArduinoLEDDisplay
A project to learn about individually addressable LED matrices with microcontrollers, bluetooth, Wi-Fi and more.

## Purpose
Create an app controlled LED display that can be used to display information, graphics or animations. The application
should be made using Flutter/Dart and the device itself should be able to communicate with other devices via Wi-Fi 
and Bluetooth. For initial interations, I would like to investigate different clock design ideas I have for the 8x8
display, scrolling text for the 8x32 display and more.

Unfortunately I have exams comming up so this may end up being a summer project.

## Hardware (so far)
- Arduino Uno R3
- Generic WS2128B LED Matrices (8x8, 16x16 and 8x32)
